Chaitu-09/23 : Great Job Ashi. Minor feedback on the Top Navigation bar when clicked on 'Plastix Thinker',
When you click on the 'Plastix Thinker' on the top Navigation, Navigation bar is hiding 'Plastix Thinker' option which is not consistant with other pages. Think about the option to still show Plasix Thinker just like other pages.
This will make the page consistant with other pages and will look better.

Also, when you click on 'Contact' from the 'Plastix Thinker' page, it is redirecting to a different page and the CSS is not right. Please check that.

Other than that, I did not see any thing out of order. Great work and proud of you :)
